Contribution Guides
---------------------------

In the spirit of open source software development, jQuery always encourages community code contribution. To help you get started and before you jump into writing code, be sure to read these important contribution guidelines thoroughly:

1. [Getting Involved](http://contribute.jquery.org/)
2. [JavaScript Style Guide](http://contribute.jquery.org/style-guide/js/)
3. [Writing Code for jQuery Foundation Projects](http://contribute.jquery.org/code/)

What you need to build Sizzle
---------------------------

In order to build Sizzle, you need to have Node.js/npm latest and git 1.7 or later.
(Earlier versions might work OK, but are not tested.)

For Windows you have to download and install [git](http://git-scm.com/downloads) and [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/download/).

Mac OS users should install [Homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/). Once Homebrew is installed, run `brew install git` to install git,
and `brew install node` to install Node.js.

Linux/BSD users should use their appropriate package managers to install git and Node.js, or build from source
if you swing that way. Easy-peasy.


How to build Sizzle
----------------------------

Clone a copy of the main Sizzle git repo by running:

```bash
git clone git://github.com/jquery/sizzle.git
```

In the `sizzle/dist` folder you will find build version of sizzle along with the minified copy and associated map file.

Testing
----------------------------

- Run `npm install`, it's also preferable (but not necessarily) to globally install `grunt-cli` package â€“ `npm install -g grunt-cli`
- Open `test/index.html` in the browser or run `npm test` or `grunt test` on the command line
- The actual unit tests are in the `test/unit` directory.

Developing with [grunt](http://gruntjs.com)
----------------------------

- `npm run build` or `grunt` will lint, build, test, and compare the sizes of the built files.
- `npm start` or `grunt start` can be run to re-lint, re-build, and re-test files as you change them.
- `grunt -help` will show other available commands
